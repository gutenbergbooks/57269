 <p class="small">BY</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Capt.</i> Peter Ferdinand de Quir, <i>touching
the Discovery of the Fifth part of
the World, called</i> Terra Australis
Incognita, <i>and of the great Riches
and Fertility of the same</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class="smcap gesperrt large">Sir,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I am called Captain <i>Peter Ferdinand
De Quir</i>, a most humble Servant
and Subject of your Majesty's, who
in all Submission do shew unto
you, that this is the Eighth Petition,
which by me hath been presented to your
Majesty's View, to perswade the Conduction
of some Colonies, unto the
Land which your Majesty hath commanded
to be discovered in the Country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
of <i>Terra Australis incognita</i>: And
yet to this Hour no Resolution is taken
in this Affair, neither have I received
any Answer or Hope, whereby I might
rest assured to obtain my Dispatch, although
I have attended Fourteen Months
in your Court, and have employ'd Fourteen
Years in this Discovery, unto the
which I have been induced by the meer
Goodness of the Cause, and in the Assuredness
of the same have obdurated
my self against all Difficulties and Contradictions
whatsoever. I have desperately
exposed my self to a thousand Perils
both by Sea and Land, I have diminished
and sunk my Estate, I have been
travailed with many Afflictions in my
Person, and suffered such strange and
extraordinary Crosses, that they seem almost
incredible to my self; and all, that
so Religious an Undertake should not
unworthily be abandoned. In regard
whereof, I do most humbly beseech your
Majesty in the Bowels of the Divine
Charity, that you would be pleased to
take Order, that I be not deprived of
the Fruits of this Design, which with
such Instance I do desire, and which
with so much Justice are due unto my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
continual Pains and Travel: Nor that I
be debarr'd from the Effects of so considerable
and well-grounded a Request,
whose principal Scope is the Glory of
God, and of your Majesty, and from
whence infinite Benefits are likely to issue
forth, which will live as long as the Fabrick
of the World shall subsist, and after
the Dissolution thereof, will remain to all
Eternity.</p>

<p>Touching the Extent of these Regions
newly discovered, grounding my
Judgment on that which I have seen
with mine own Eyes, and upon that
which Captain <i>Lewes Paez de Terres</i> Admiral
of my Fleet, hath represented unto
your Majesty, the Length thereof is
as great as all <i>Europe</i> and <i>Asia the Less</i>,
unto the Sea of <i>Bachu</i>, <i>Persia</i>, and all the
Isles, as well of the Ocean, as of the
<i>Medeterranean</i> Sea, taking <i>England</i> and
<i>Island</i> into this Account.</p>

<p>This unknown Country is the Fifth
part of the Terrestrial Globe, and extendeth
it self to such Length, that in
probability it is twice greater in Kingdoms
and Seignories, than all that
which at this Day doth acknowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
Subjection and Obedience unto your Majesty.</p>

<p>These Regions know no Neighbourhood
either of <i>Turks</i> or <i>Moors</i>, or of
any other Nation which attempteth War
upon confining Countries. The Land
which we have discovered is all seated
within the <i>Torrid Zone</i>, and a great
Tract thereof reacheth unto the Equinoctial
Circle, which is elevated unto
them to 90 Degrees above the Horizon,
and in some Places a little less. And if
the Success prove answerable unto the
Hopes, there will be found <i>Antipodes</i> unto
the better part of <i>Africk</i>, unto all
<i>Europe</i>, and to the greater Portion of
<i>Asia</i>. But you must observe, that as
the Countries which we have discover'd
in 15 Degrees of Latitude, are better
than <i>Spain</i>, so the other which are opposed
to their Elevation, must by Proportion
and Analogy prove some Terrestrial
Paradise.</p>

<p>All those Quarters swarm with an incredible
Multitude of inhabitants, whereof
some are white, others black, and in
Colour like unto those which the <i>Spaniards</i>
call <i>Mulatos</i>, or half <i>Moors</i>, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
others of a mingled Complexion. Some!
wear their Hair long, black, and scatter'd,
others have their Hair crisped and
thick, and others very yellow and bright.
Which Diversity is an apparent Argument,
that there is Commerce and Communication
amongst them. And this
Consideration, together with the Bounty
which Nature hath bestowed on the
Soil, their Inexperience of Artillery and
Guns, and their Unskilfulness in labouring
in Mines, with other semblable Circumstances,
doth induce me to infer, that
all the Country is rich and well-peopled.
It seemeth they know little what belongeth
to Artificial Trades; for they have
neither Fortifications nor Walls, and live
without the Awe of Kings or Laws.
They are a simple People, canton'd into'
several Sects, and Factions, and exercise
much Disagreement amongst themselves.
The Arms which they use are Bows and
Arrows, which are not poisoned or steeped
in the Juice of venomous Herbs, as the
Custom is of many other Countries:
They do also carry Clubs, Truncheons,
Pikes, Darts, to hurl with the Arm, all
which ate framed only of Wood. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
do cover themselves from the Waste of
Girdling-place down to the half of their
Thighs; they are very studious of
Cleanliness, tractable, gleeful, and wonderously
addicted to be grateful unto
those that do them a Courtesie, as I
have experienced many times. The
which doth build in me a belief, that,
with the Assistance of God, if they may
be gently and amiably intreated, they
will be found very docible and easie of
Manage, and that we shall without much
Work accommodate our selves unto them.
And it is most necessary to observe this
way of Sweetness, especially in the Beginning,
that the Inhabitants may be
drawn along to this so holy and saving
an End, whereof we ought to take a particular
Care and Zeal, as well in small
things, as in Matters of more Importance.
Their Houses are built of Wood,
covered and tiled with Palm-tree Leaves;
they have Pitchers and Vessels made of
Earth, they are not without the Mystery
of Weaving, and other Curiosities of that
kind. They work on Marble, they have
Flutes, Drums and Wooden-Spoons, they
set apart certain Places for Oratories and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
Prayers, and for Church-yards. Their
Gardens are artificially severed into Beds,
bordered and fashioned with distinct Limits;
Mother of Pearl, and the Shells
which contain Pearl, they have in much
use and Estimation, of which they make
Wedges, Razors, Saws, Cutters, and such
like instruments; They also do make
thereof Pearls and great Beads to wear
about their Necks; they that do dwell
in the Islands have Boats very artificially
made, and exceedingly commodious for
Sailing, which is a certain Argument that
they confine upon other Nations that are
of a more polished and elegant Behaviour.
And this also they have of our Husbandry,
that they cut Cocks and geld Boars.</p>

<p>Their Bread is usually made of three
Sorts of Roots, which grow there in great
abundance. Neither do they employ
much Labour in making this Bread, for
they do only roast the Roots until they
are soft and tender. They are very pleasant
to the Taste, wholsome and nourishing,
they are of a good Length, there
being of them of an Ell long, and the
half of that in Bigness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
There is great store of excellent Fruits
in these Countries. There are six kinds
of Maple-trees, Almond-trees of four
sorts, and other Trees called <i>Obi</i>, resembling
almost in Fruit and Greatness our
Quince-trees. Innumerable Walnut-trees
are found there, and of Citron-trees
the Barbarians have no Dearth, nor of
other great and excellent Fruits, which
we have seen and tasted. They have
moreover Sugar-Canes, large in Size, and
in great Plenty; they have Knowledge
of our ordinary Apples; they have Palm-trees
without Number, out of which
there may easily be drawn a Juice, which
will make a Liquor alluding much to
Wine, as also Whey, Vinegar, and Honey,
the Kernels thereof are exceeding sweet.
And they have Fruits which the <i>Indians</i>
call <i>Cocos</i>, which being green do make a
kind of Twine, and the Pith is almost
like in Taste unto the Cream of Milk:
When they are ripe they serve for Meat
and Drink both by Land and Sea; And
when they wither and fall from the Tree,
there sweateth out an Oil from them,
which is very good to burn in Lamps,
and is medicinable for Wounds, and not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
unpleasant to be eaten. Of their Rinds
or Barks there are made Bottles, and other
like Vessels, and the inner Skin doth
serve for Tow or Moss to stop and close
up the Leakes in Ships. Men do make
Cables and other Cordage of them, which
are of sufficient Strength to draw a Cannon,
and are fit for other domestick Uses.
But that which is more special, they do
there use the Leaves of Palm-trees, which
they amass together, to make Sails of
them for Vessels of small Bulk and Burthen.
They make likewise fine thin
Matts of them, and they do serve for
Tiles to cover the House without, and
for Hangings to cloath the House within.
And these Houses are built of the
Branches of Trees that are strait and long,
of which they do likewise make Pikes,
and other sorts of Weapons, as also Oars
to row with, and Utensils for the House.
You are to note, that these Palm-trees
resemble Vines, from whence they gather
their Materials for Wine all the Year
long, which they make without much
Cost, or Labour. Amongst their Herbage
and Garden-Fruits; we have seen Melons,
Pears great and little, and sundry sorts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
of Pot-Herbs. And they have also Beans
For Flesh, they are stored with a great
Number of Hogs, which are like unto
ours. They have Hens, Capons, Partridges,
Ducks, Turtles, Pigeons, Stock-Doves,
and Goats, as one of my Captains
doth relate. And the <i>Indians</i> themselves
have assured us that there are
Cows and Oxen. There are also sundry
sorts of Fish, Harghi, Persereyes, Lize,
Soles, Trouts, Shads, Macabises, Casanes,
Pampani, Pilchards, Thorn-backs or Skate-fish,
Cuculi, Congers, Porposes, Rochets,
Muskles, Lobsters, and many other, the
Names whereof I cannot now remember.
But it is probable that there are divers
other kinds, since those which I have recounted
were taken hard by our Ships.
And upon ripe and serious Consideration
of that which I have represented
unto you, a Man may easily collect,
that such plentiful and different Varieties
of all things, may yield large means
to inhabit there, with great and singular
Delights. There is Stuff for Marchpanes
and sweet Confections of all sorts,
without borrowing any Spice for the
Composition of them elsewhere. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
for my Mates the Mariners, besides
those Particulars which I have before set
down, there will be no want of Gammons,
Sausages, and other salt Meats
which Hogs do yield; neither of Vinegar,
Spiceries, and other Sauces that serve
for Delicacy, and to awake the Appetite.
And you must observe, that many
of these things are the same with those
which we have in our Parts, and possibly
they are there in greater abundance;
by all which it is easily to be conjectured,
that this Country is fit for the production
of all that which groweth in <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<p>The Riches which I have seen in those
parts is Silver and Pearl. Another Captain
in his Relation doth report, that he
hath seen Gold, which are the three
most precious Darlings that lie and are
cherished in the Bosom of Nature. We
have also both of us seen many Nutmegs,
much Mastick, Ginger, and Pepper. There
is also Cinamon; and it is likely that
Cloves may be found in those parts, since
so many other sorts of Spiceries and Aromatical
Drugs do prosper there; and that
the rather, because these Countries lie very
near the parallel of the Isles of <i>Terre-natte</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
<i>Bachian</i>, and the <i>Moluccos</i>. There
are likewise Materials for all sorts of
Silk, and we have seen Anise-seed and
excellent good Ebony, as also other kind?
of Wood proper for the Building of as
many Ships as one will desire, and Stuff
to make Sails for the same. Three sorts
of Materials there are wherewithal to
make Cordage, and one of them is very
like unto our Hemp. Moreover, out of
the Oil of <i>Cocos</i>, whereof I have already
made mention, there is a kind of bituminous
Stuff extracted, called <i>Galagala</i>,
which may be well used for Pitch. They
make also a kind of Rosen, with which
the <i>Indians</i> pitch their Boats, which they
call <i>Piraques</i>. And since there are Goats
and Cows in those parts, without question
we shall have Goat-Skins, Leather,
Tallow, and Flesh in full abundance.
The Bees which we have seen there do
make proof, that there will be no Scarcity
of Honey and Wax. And there is
good Appearance to discover many other
things which are not yet known, to say
nothing touching the Form and Site of
the Country. Unto all which, if that
be adjoined, which the Industry of Man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
may contribute to those Parts, since there
is such abundance of Commodities, which
the Country itself doth yield, and such
Hope to transport thither those things
which grow with us, the best and choicest
whereof that <i>Peru</i> and <i>New Spain</i> bring
forth, I have resolved to transfer thither;
it is to be hoped that this will so enrich
that Country, that it will be able to nourish
and furnish not only the Inhabitants
of the same, and those of <i>America</i>, but
give an Accession unto <i>Spain</i> itself both of
Riches and Extent of Command: And
this may be accomplished after the manner
which I have projected, and will unfold
unto those which shall lend an assisting
Hand for the Guiding and Consummation
of this Work.</p>

<p>Now by that Land which we have
already discovered outwardly and along
the Shores, without Entrance into the
inward Parts, we do conceive a certain
Argument, that as much Riches, Commodities,
and Greatness, may be hoped
for from thence, as we have already in
these Countries. And you may be pleased
to understand that my principal Aim was
to take a View only of those ample Regions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
which we have discovered; for by
reason of many Sicknesses which have
weakened me, and some other Chances,
whereof I will at this time make no mention,
I was not able to survey all which
I desired, neither could I in a full Month
have seen all that, which I was of my
self inclinable to view.</p>

<p>You are not to make your Judgment of
the <i>Indians</i> that inhabit these Countries according
to the Honour of the People here,
or conceive them to be affected with the
same Desires, Pleasures, Necessities, or Estimation
of things that we are: But you
are to make account that they are a People
whose Care is studiously placed upon
this, that they may live easily in this
World, and pass their Days with the
least Pain and Perturbation they can. And
this is indeed their Practice, for they do
not bestow themselves on those things,
which with such Vexation and Torment
we here labour to obtain.</p>

<p>There are found in this Country as
many Commodities, both for the Support
and Delectation of the Life of Man,
as may be expected from a Soil that is
manurable, pleasant and very temperate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
It is a fat and a fertile Land, where in
many places Clay is found, which will
prove of excellent Use to build Houses,
and to make Tiles and Bricks, and will
serve for whatsoever is usually made of
Earth. There is no Dearth of Marble
and other good Stones, wherewith, if
there be Occasion, there may be built
Structures of greater State and Magnificence.</p>

<p>The Country aboundeth in Wood, fit
for all Works and Uses, whereunto the
same is commonly put. There are spacious
and goodly Plains, and Fields that
are divided and interlaced with Brooks,
Trenches and Rivers. There are great
and high Rocks, sundry Torrents, Rivers
great and little, on Which Water-mills for
Corn may, with much Commodiousness,
be built and placed, as also Engines to
make Sugar, Tucking mills, Forges, and
all other Instruments which in their Use
do require Water.</p>

<p>We have found Salt-pits there, and,
which is a Note of the Fertility of the
Soil, there are in many places Canes,
whereof some are five of six Handfuls
thick, with Fruit answerable to that Proportion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
The Top of that Fruit is very
small and hard, and the Skin thereof is
exceeding sweet. There are also Flints
for Fire, equal in Goodness to those of
<i>Madrid</i>. The Bay of St. <i>James</i> and St. <i>Philip</i>
hath twenty Leagues of Bank, and
is without Mud, into which there is a
sure and safe Entrance both by Day and
Night. It is sheltered and covered with
many Houses, which in the Day-time we
have seen a far off to send forth Smoak,
and in the Night to shew forth Fire.</p>

<p>The Haven, called <i>The true Cross</i>, is of
that spacious Capacity, that it is able to
contain a Thousand Ships. The Bottom,
as I have said, is without Mud, and hath
a blackish colour'd Sand wherewithal it
is covered. There are no Gulfs or deep
Pits, but an assured and easie Anchorage
in what part soever you will, from
forty to half a Fathom; and it is between
the Mouths of two Rivers, the one whereof
is as great as that of <i>Quadalguiver</i>,
and hath Mud of a Fathom deep, over
which our Shalops and Boats did pass.</p>

<p>For the other River, when our Skiffs
went to water there, they found the Entrance
safe and easie. And a Man may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
from the very Mouth of the River take
in as much fresh Water as he will. The
place where Ships may be unloaded hath
three Leagues of Gravel, mingled with
little Flints, blackish and very heavy,
which will serve for Balast for Ships.
The Bank is straight and united, on
which much green Grass doth grow and
prosper, and that makes me to conceive
that the Sea doth not beat or rage thereupon:
I observe that the Trees are
strait, and the Branches not dismembred,
which is a Token that there are no Tempests
there. Touching the Port, besides
the Commodities which I have already
discoursed of, there is one of marvellous
Pleasure and Contentation. And that is,
at the Dawning of the Day you shall
hear from a Wood, which is near at
hand, a sweet and various Harmony of
a thousand Birds of all sorts, amongst
which we could distinguish the Nightingales,
Black-birds, Quails, Goldfinches,
Swallows almost without Number, Parrochito's,
and one Parrot we marked there,
and Creatures of sundry other kinds, even
down to Grass-hoppers and Field-Crickets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
Every Morning and Evening we received
a most odoriferous sweet Smell,
sent unto our Nostrils from the infinite
Diversity of Flowers and Herbs which
grow there, amongst which we observed
the Blossoms of Oranges and Basil. All
which (with a Number of other Varieties)
doth make us think that the Air is
clear and healthy, and that the Nature
of the place is of a good Temperature,
The Haven and Bay are therefore of the
greater Estimation, because they have the
Neighbourhood of so many goodly Islands
that are there, and especially of
those Seven which are said to have 200
Leagues of Extent: And surely one of
them (which is some twelve Leagues
distant from the Haven) is fifty Leagues
in Circuit. In brief, <i>Sir</i>, I do affirm unto
your Majesty, that you may give
Command to have a goodly and great
City built in this Port and Bay, which
are in fifteen Degrees and forty Minutes
of the Southern Elevation, and those
that shall inhabit there shall have plenty
of Riches, and all other Conveniences
which they can desire. Time will shew
and discover all these Commodities, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
in this place there may be made the
Discharge and Unloading of all the Wares
and Merchandizes of the Countries of
<i>Chilly</i>, <i>Peru</i>, <i>Panania</i>, <i>Macaraqua</i>, <i>Guttimala</i>,
<i>New-Spain</i>, <i>Terre-natte</i>, and the <i>Philippines</i>,
all which Countries are under
the Command of your Majesty. And
if you shall acquire unto your self the
Dominion of these Seigniories which I
do now present, I do make so great an
Esteem of them, that besides their being
the Key of all the rest, they will (in my
Opinion) prove another <i>China</i> or <i>Japan</i>,
and equalize the other rich Islands which
are on this side of <i>Asia</i> in Traffick of curious
and precious Merchandizes, to
speak nothing of the Augmentation and
Extent of your Power, and the Establishment
which you may make unto your
self of your Dominions by the Accession
of so great a Country. That which I
have given unto your View in my Discourse
is of much Slenderness, in regard of
that which I do probably conceive of this
Land, the which I am ready to make
appear in the Presence of Mathematicians.
Neither will I vex this Paper to demonstrate
unto you, that these Countries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
will be able at the first Aboord to nourish
20000 <i>Spaniards</i>. In Sum this is,
<i>Sir</i>, the World whereof <i>Spain</i> is the
Center, and that which I have related,
is the Nail by which you may judge of
the whole Body, which I pray you to
take into your Observation.</p>

<p>You may judge by that which I have
already represented, what the Goodness
and Temperature of the Air is; whereunto
this may be added for a further Testimony,
that although all our Company
were Strangers, yet never a one of them
was sick, albeit they were in continual
Travel and Labour, and did sometimes
sweat, and sometimes take Wet. They
drank Water fasting, and fed many times
on that which the Earth did there bring
forth. Neither had they any regard to keep
themselves from the Serenes, nor from
the Moon or Sun, which indeed in those
Parts is not over-vehement. Only about
Mid-night, they covered themselves with
Wool, and did lie and repose themselves
thereupon. And for the Inhabitants, they
are commonly healthy, and many of
them very aged, although they have nothing
but the bare Earth for their Pallet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
which is an Argument of the Wholesomeness
and Pureness of the Soil. For if it
were a wet and weeping Ground, or had
any Viciousness in the Mould, they would
raise their Lodgings higher from the
Earth, as they do that live in the <i>Philippines</i>,
and other Countries which I
have viewed. And this is further confirmed
by their Flesh and Fish, which although
it be unsalted, yet will it keep
sweet, and without Corruption two Days.
And the Fruits which are brought from
thence are exceeding good, as we had
Proof by two that I took care to bring along
with me, altho' they had not their
full Maturity and Growth when I gathered
them from the Tree. We have not
seen any barren and sandy Ground, nor
any Thistles, or Trees that are thorny,
of whose Roots do shew themselves, no
Marshes or Fenns, no Snow upon the
Mountains, no Snakes or Serpents, no
Crocodiles in the Rivers, no Worms that
use with us to hurt and consume our
Grain, and to work us so much Displeasure
in our Houses, no Fleas, Catterpillers,
or Gnats. This is a Prerogative
that hath the Advantage of all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
Privileges that Nature hath bestowed on
other Places, and is worthy to be compared,
or rather preferred before any
Delicacy of the Countries of <i>India</i>, some
of which are abandoned and uninhabited,
meerly by reason of these Incommodities,
and of sundry others that are
distastful unto the Inhabitants, as my self
have oftentimes been Witness.</p>

<p>These (<i>Sir</i>) are the Vertues and
Excellences of the Countries which I
have discovered, of which I have already
taken the Possession in the Name of your
Majesty and under your Royal Banner,
as appeareth by the Acts which I keep
safely in my Power, whereunto I proceeded
after this ensuing manner.</p>

<p>First (<i>Sir</i>) we erected a Cross, and
built a Church in Honour of our Lady
of <i>Loretto</i>. Then we caused Twenty
Masses to be celebrated there, and our
Troops made haste thither to gain some
Indulgences. We also made a solemn
Procession, and observed the Feast of the
Blessed Sacrament, the which was carry'd
in Procession, your Banner being ever displayed,
and marching before it thro' a great
Circuit of Countries, which were honour'd
with the Presence of the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
In three several Places we set up your
Titles, in every one of which we prepared
and erected two Columns, with
the Arms of your Majesty tricked and
garnished thereupon: so that I may with
good Right affirm, that since this will
challenge to be one of the Parts of the
World, the Impress of <i>Plus ultra</i> is accomplished,
and because it stretcheth
unto the Continent, whether it be forward
or behind it skills not, the Bounds
of your Dominions are with much Spaciousness
enlarged. Now all this which
I have performed receiveth its Root from
this the faithful Zeal which I bear unto
your Majesty, that to all the Titles which
you already do possess, you may adjoin
this which I represent, and that the Name
of <span class="smcap">Terra Australis Incognita</span> may be
blazoned and spread over the Face of the
whole World to the Glory of God, who
hath revealed this Country, and hath given
me the Grace to guide my Course
thither, and to return to the Presence of
your Majesty, before whom I do present
and prostrate my self with the same Affection
and Zeal unto this Work which
I had before, and which hath grown up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
with me as it were from my Cradle,
and for the Nobleness and Worth thereof,
I do still tender and cherish the same
with the greatest Love that can be.</p>

<p>I do confidently believe, that your
Majesty doth use so much Prudence in
your Councils, and are so magnanimous
and full of Christian Piety, that you
will (with your best Care) embrace all the
Conducements which may further the
Habitation of these new discovered Countries.
And the principal Reason to put
a Tye and Obligation upon us not to
leave them abandoned, is, in regard that
this is the sole ordinary way to establish
the Knowledge of God, and Faith among
them, and to bring to pass that his Name
may be adored and called upon, where
the Devil usurpeth so much Reverence
and Invocation. And this ought to be
embraced with the more Readiness, because
it is the Channel to convey and
disperse all abundance of Commodities
amongst your Subjects. And hereby you
shall be eased of many Disturbances and
Vexations, which will assuredly be put
upon you, in case the Hereticks should
enter and nestle there, and should vent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
their erroneous Doctrines amongst them,
whereby they would convert all the
Blessings which I have hitherto recounted
unto you, into assured Incommodities
and Mischiefs, and would arrogate unto
themselves the Name of the Lords of
the <i>Indies</i>, to the utter Ruin and Desolation
of those Countries. I make no
question but your Majesty well weigheth
of what Importance this Danger of
which I speak may prove, and what evil
Consequence some other Hazards may carry
with them, which are either at this time
imminent, or may succeed hereafter. And
if this should happen, it would cost you
innumerable Thousands of Gold and Men,
before you shall be able to give a Remedy
unto the same. Acquire therefore,
<i>Sir</i>, while that Occasion is offered you
(that one Day you may purchase Heaven
unto yourself:) Acquire (I say) with
a little Money, which you misplace upon
<i>Peru</i>, a never-dying Reputation, and this
<i>New World</i> with all the Benefits which
it reacheth out unto you. And since
there is none that craveth a Reward for
these good Tidings that is brought you
concerning so great and singular a Blessing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
which God hath been pleased to
lock up until your happy time, I am he,
<i>Sir</i>, that do demand it, and my humble
Request unto you is only this, That
you would be of that Graciousness unto
me, as to dispatch and give me mine
Answer; for the Galleons are ready to
hoise Sail, and I have much way to go,
and many things must be fitted and disposed
for the Voyage. There is no Hour
passes, which carrieth not with it an assured
Loss both in regard of spiritual and
temporal Blessings, the Damage whereof
can never be made up or repaired.</p>

<p>If upon a bare Suspicion <i>Christophorus
Columbus</i> did pursue his Design with so
much Obstinacy, you are not to account
it strange in me if the Things which I
have beheld with mine Eyes, and touch'd
with mine Hands, do put some kind of
Constraint upon me to be importunate.</p>

<p>Let it therefore please your Majesty,
amongst so many Expedients which you
have at hand, to lever and put apart some
one for the Accomplishment of this Work,
that after all these Languishments, I may
at length meet with the Success of my
Desires. I do assure you that you will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
find my Propositions most just, and that
I shall be of Sufficiency to give you Satisfaction
in all things. This, <i>Sir</i>, is a
great Work, against which the Devil doth
bandy himself with all the Puissance he
may; and it is not consonant to Reason,
to abandon these Countries to his Tyranny
and Power, which do know your
Majesty for their Patron and Defender.</p>
